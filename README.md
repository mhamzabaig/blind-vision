This project is dedicated to low vision people and is inclined to help them in walking by Leveraging AI/Computer Vision and ParalellProcessing.
1st Milestone: It contains Yolov5s and MiDaS to identify and find out estimated depth from the user to either classify whether the user is in danger or not.
               Due to High speed with moderate precision yolov5s is added with MiDaS with paralell processing to compute faster results in realtime. 
               Therefore their combination contains cheap processing power when this solution will be implemented in dedicated IoT based chip/system.
